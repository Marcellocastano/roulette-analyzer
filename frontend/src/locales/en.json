However, this should not be interpreted as an invitation to bet on \"lagging dozens,\" as the law only works over very long periods. The strategy, therefore, allows you to <strong>improve your chances of success when applied correctly alongside other principles</strong>."

If the percentage of occurrence in this zone is <strong>below the average (20%)</strong> at both 50 and 500 spins, the zone is considered \"lagging.\" A lag indicates that these numbers are not appearing as expected, creating an imbalance according to the law of large numbers: <strong>this could be the ideal time to bet on them</strong>."

This process occurs autonomously thanks to the algorithmic model embedded in the software."

The spin should be done by restarting the ball (more or less) at the <strong>height of the last number drawn</strong>. If, for example, the last number drawn is a 5, the croupier should reverse the turn of the wheel, take the ball and restart it at the height of 5. If he throws the ball too far from the last number drawn or delays in starting the spin, it could compromise the statistical sequences. <strong>In these cases, the table should be avoided, even if the conditions seem favorable.</strong>"
