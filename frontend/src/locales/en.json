        "title": "Law of large numbers",
        "content": "The law of large numbers applied to roulette means that, over a very high number of spins, the frequency of numbers or various areas of the table tends to balance out. This, however, should not be interpreted as an invitation to bet on the 'deficient dozens', because the law only works over very long periods. The strategy, therefore, allows you to improve the chances of success when applied correctly together with the other principles."

        "content": "The method focuses mainly on the 'ZERO zone', i.e. the numbers between 12 and 15. If the percentage of this zone is below average (20%) at both 50 and 500 spins, the zone is considered 'delayed'. A delay indicates that these numbers are not coming out as expected, creating an imbalance according to the law of large numbers: it could therefore be the ideal time to bet on them."

Numbers that, starting from a low frequency in the first 50 spins, begin to recover in the next 500 are to be taken into consideration: this growth suggests that they will tend to balance over time and could be more frequent in the next spins."

'Growing' means that these numbers have a low frequency in the first 50 spins, but show an increase in the next 500. These numbers tend to balance out in the long run and are therefore the ones to consider most."

The numbers generated by the software are divided into three betting intensities: yellow (lowest), orange (intermediate) and red (highest).<br />For example: €1 for each yellow number, €3 for orange numbers and €5 for red numbers. In case of winnings, you can gradually increase the bets.<br />Avoid continuing to play in case of losses: insisting could cause further damage to your finances.

The spin should be done by restarting the ball (more or less) at the <strong>height of the last number drawn</strong>. If, for example, the last number drawn is a 5, the croupier should reverse the turn of the wheel, take the ball and restart it at the height of 5. If he throws the ball too far from the last number drawn or delays in starting the spin, it could compromise the statistical sequences. <strong>In these cases, the table should be avoided, even if the conditions seem favorable.</strong>"
